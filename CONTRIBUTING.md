# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Nouns**: The nouns used for suggesting names should be simple, respectful, and related to technology or nerdy content. They should be a single word. Avoid using jargon or acronyms that might not be universally understood.

2. **Adjectives**: The adjectives used should also be simple, respectful, and a single word. They should be able to describe or add a unique characteristic to the noun they are paired with.

3. **Respect**: Please ensure that the names suggested are respectful and inclusive. Avoid any words that might be considered discriminatory, inappropriate, or disrespectful in any form.

4. **Creativity**: Feel free to be creative with the names, as long as they adhere to the above guidelines. Unique and interesting names make our project more engaging and memorable.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to seeing your creative suggestions!
